# Infix + Posfix Notation
Hey guys!üñêÔ∏è

This is a JAVA Project where I solve math expressions in infix and posfix notations.

Here you have a menu of options where you can create and calculate expressions, translating them
from infix to posfix notation.

I've applied knowledge of:
- Data Structres, such as Stack
- Exception Handling
- Basics from Java (loops, conditionals,...)

**I hope you enjoy it!ü§ü**
